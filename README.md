#### Let's play with convolutional neural network here

# CNN from scratch

Implemented CNN from scratch in C++ and Python

# Knowledge Distillation

Trained a larger CNN model to classify images, and transferred the learning to a smaller network. This technique, known as knowledge distillation, was introduced by Geoffrey Hinton et al. in https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531
